                <p>COVID-19 is the new respiratory disease spreading around the world and it is caused by a coronavirus. COVID-19 is short for “coronavirus disease 2019.”</p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li>The virus is thought to spread mainly between people who are in close contact with one another (about 6 feet) and through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</li>
                    <li>People are most contagious when they are the sickest. But those who don’t have a lot of symptoms can still pass the virus on to others.</li>
                    <li>There is currently no vaccine or cure for COVID-19 but researchers are working to find one.</li>

                    <li>Rinse your hands under clean, running water. Air dry or use a clean towel.</li>
                    <li>No soap or water? Use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol. Apply the gel to the palm of one hand. Rub your hands together over all of your hands’ surfaces and fingers until your hands are dry.</li>
                    <li>Avoid touching your face and eyes.</li>

Avoid sharing personal items such as dishes, towels, and bedding with other people in your house. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces often. Wash laundry frequently.</li>
                    <li>Have a household member or friend run errands for you like picking up groceries or prescriptions.</li>
                    <li>Wear a mask if you have to be around other people. If you can’t find a mask, create one from a garment like a scarf. If you can’t wear a mask because of difficulty breathing, make sure caregivers wear one around you.</li>

                    <li>It’s always a good idea to routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces like tables, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, toilets, faucets, and sinks. But if you have a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19, be vigilant about doing this daily.</li>
                    <li>First, clean dirty surfaces with soap and water. Cleaning will remove dirt and lower the number of germs—but it will not kill germs.</li>
                    <li>Next, disinfect surfaces to kill germs. Disinfecting after cleaning can further lower the risk of spreading an infection. Most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work. Or dilute your household bleach with 1/3 cup of bleach per gallon of water.</li>
                    <li>Wear dedicated gloves for COVID-19 related cleaning and disinfecting or use disposable gloves and discard them after each use.</li>
